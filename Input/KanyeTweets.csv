Again back to dependents. You need a business manager to read how you did? So you pay to see your money!!! NO MORE.

the first thing that changes about Record Deals is actually lawyers.
We need Plain English contracts. A Lawyers role is to IMPROVE deals…. not charge for contracts we cannot understand or track. Re-write deals to be understandable from FIRST READ"
